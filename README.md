# 2020
Hacktoberfest 2020 project 

2020 is possibly the worst year so far.
I think we can all agree when we say we would like to dig a hole and bury ourselves in it, with this year's situation.  

But look on the bright side! 
We did have some gain due to the situation too! More time to exercise, spend time with our family, and even ourselves... Moreover, many can also agree that this was also a great window of opportunity, to pick up a new skill/interest, to learn to be independent with Home-based-learning, and the list goes on.

And thankfully some governments and people have played their part in containing the spread of coronavirus. 
At any rate, 2020 is ending soon. Let's just hope 2021 takes a turn for the better!
